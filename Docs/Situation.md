## 1. SITUATION

**a. General.**  

  1. In recent years, Russian rhetoric has continued to argue it’s claim over former Soviet era territories such as the country of Georgia. Over the last several weeks, Russian Armed Forces have amassed along the Northern Georgia border in what was perceived to be a repeat of annual military exercises within the region.

  2. At 0325L, Russian forces launched coordinated ground and airborne assaults along the northern border quickly overwhelming and occupying significant portions of territory. Initial reports indicate that Russian forces have occupied territory as far south as Sukhumi-Babushara, approximately 60NM South of Georgia’s Northern border.

  3. NATO Peacekeeping Forces prepositioned in the theater have reportedly responded to and stalled the Russian advance IVO Sukhumi-Babushara.
